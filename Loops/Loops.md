# C++ Loops Guide

In C++, for loop is an entry-controlled loop that is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for the given number of times. It is generally preferred over while and do-while loops in case the number of iterations is known beforehand.

## üîÅ Types of Loops in C++

C++ provides three types of loops that works the same, but are preferred in different use cases:

- **for** Loop
- **while** Loop
- **do-while** Loop

### 1. **for Loop**
In C++, for loop is an entry-controlled loop that is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for the given number of times.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

### 2. **while Loop**

**Syntax:**
```
while (condition) {
    // Body of the loop
    update expression
}
```

---

### 3. **do-while Loop**

**Syntax:**
```
do {
    // Body of the loop
    // Update expression
} while (condition);
```
