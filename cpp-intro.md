# 💻 Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. It is widely used in software development, system/software engineering, game development, competitive programming, and more.

## 🚀 What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in **1979** as an extension of the C programming language. It added **object-oriented features** like classes and inheritance to C, while still retaining the speed and low-level functionality of C.

## 🧠 Key Features of C++

- ✅ **Statically typed** language
- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** support
- ⚡ **Fast and efficient**: close to hardware
- 📦 **Standard Template Library (STL)** for built-in data structures and algorithms
- 🔄 **Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming**
- 🧩 **Modular and reusable code**
- 🖥️ **Portable**: runs on various platforms with minimal changes

## 🔤 Hello World in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 🧱 Basic Structure of a C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // Header file
using namespace std; // Standard namespace

int main() {         // Main function: entry point
    // Code block
    return 0;        // Return statement
}
```
